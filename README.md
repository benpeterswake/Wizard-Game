# Wizard-Game
Javascript game

This game is written in Jquery, html and css.

The approach I took was to split the game into different scenes.

Instructions:
Use left and right arrow keys to move.
Use A key to cast a fireball.

Unsolved Problems:
The fireball attack can still be used on some scenes where it should be disabled.
